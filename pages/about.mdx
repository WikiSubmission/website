# About

WikiSubmission is a knowledge base for Submission, the 'One Unified Religion' as preached by all messengers starting from Abraham to others after him including Moses (1200 BCE), Jesus (27 CE), Muhammed (610 CE), and Rashad (1980 CE). The universal message of Submission is to worship God alone. By focusing entirely on God and the message, this also eliminates the 'human factor' afflicting most traditional religions today. Submission is a final consolidation of the universal message found in the Old, New, and Final Testament. It is additionally backed by the world's first physical evidence for God, [Code 19](/code-19), which proves 1) the existence of God, 2) the authenticity of the Final Testament "Quran", 3) the truth behind why we are here and where we are going.

This site, launched in mid-2024, is a collective effort of various Submitters from across the world for a unified knowledge platform.

The goals of this site include:

* Represent the worldview of Submitters in a peer-reviewed and professional manner.
* Serve as an open platform where Submitters around the world can publish their research and contribute their knowledge.
* Maintain an open source and trail for all updates to this website.
* Encourage others towards research and development.
* Organize and host important resources related to Submission.
