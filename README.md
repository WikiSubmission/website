This is the official repository for the WikiSubmission.org website.

To run on your machine:

1. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/WikiSubmission/website`) and navigate to the new directory

2. Install dependencies using `pnpm i`

3. Run server using `pnpm run dev`

4. The site will be live on `http://localhost:3000` and listen for changes

(If you don't have pnpm, install it globally on your machine using `npm i pnpm -g`)

As we are in early stages, any pushes to dev branch are immediately reflected on the site.
